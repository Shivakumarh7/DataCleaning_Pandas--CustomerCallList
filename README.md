# DataCleaning_Pandas_CustomerCall_List
HERE IS MY FIRST DATA CLEANING PROJECT USING PANDAS IN THIS WE HAVE DONE : 

**1.First Look at Data** : We start by taking a quick look at the data with pandas. This helps us see how it's organized and what kind of information it has.

**2.Removing Duplicates**: Keeping our data clean is important! We'll find and remove duplicate entries using pandas to avoid misleading results. Duplicate data can skew analysis, so removing them ensures each piece of information.

**3.Dropping Columns** :To focus on the most relevant information, we'll use pandas to remove unnecessary columns from the data. This streamlines processing and analysis by concentrating on the features that contribute directly to our goals.

**4.Strip**  Introduces the strip function to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from string columns. Highlights the significance of clean and standardized text data.

**Cleaning/Standardizing Phone Numbers**: Demonstrates the process of cleaning and standardizing phone numbers using pandas. Utilizes regular expressions and the apply function to achieve a consistent format.

**6. Splitting Columns** :For better organization and analysis, we can split columns containing multiple pieces of information. For instance, an 'address' column could be split into separate columns for street, city, state, and zip code using pandas' splitting functions. Assigning clear names to the new columns helps us understand the data more easily.

**7. Standardizing Column Values using Replace**: Explores the use of the replace function to standardize values within a column. Specifically addresses the standardization of "yes" and "no" values.

**8. Fill Null Values** Covers methods for filling or handling null (missing) values in the dataset. Demonstrates the use of the fillna function to replace missing values with specified alternatives.
